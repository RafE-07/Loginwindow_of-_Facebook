# Facebook Login Form

This is a simple Facebook login form built using Python's `tkinter` library. It features basic validation for a predefined email and password. The form includes a Facebook logo image at the top and input fields for email and password.

## Features

- **GUI Interface**: Created using `tkinter`.
- **Image Handling**: Uses `PIL` (`Pillow`) to resize and display an image.
- **Login Validation**: Accepts a predefined email (`abc@gmail.com`) and password (`1234`). If the credentials match, it shows a success message, otherwise an error message is displayed.

## Requirements

To run this program, you need to install the following libraries:

- `tkinter` (comes pre-installed with Python)
- `Pillow` (for handling images)

You can install `Pillow` using pip:

```bash
pip install pillow
```
